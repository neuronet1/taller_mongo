Limitaciones aggregation
version 2.4
    Max size return document 16MB
    Memory limit 10%


Good practice
    check ok return field, if doesnt exist then it was an error

The index only can be used before any document transformation happens
(before $group, $project, $unwind)
this means than the indexes are only useful when they are to the left of
any group, project or unwind.
If you need to sort do it early at the pipeline
